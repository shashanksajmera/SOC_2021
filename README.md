### Project: Facial Recongition 
#### Mentor : Prayas Jain

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **Checkpoint 1 : 11 April 2021** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **1) Task 1 : A1** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task was based on Python Library pandas and numpy and used the functions defined in it to extract information from a dataset. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **2) Task 2 : A2** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task was based another Python Library going by the name matplotlib which was used to plot different graphs and histograms from the information extracted from datatest

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_**Overall Work Done in Phase 1**: Using python libraries to extract information from a given dataset and using which construct plots. The Notebooks for the same as listed in the folders named Task1_A1 and Task2_A2 in the reposistory._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **Checkpoint 2 : 8 June 2021** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **3) Task 4 : B3** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task invovles the Computer vision library commonly referred as OpenCV in the implementing new step of the Project. In this task we used OpenCV to find the Age and Gender of the person using webcam feed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **4) Task 5: B4** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task also invovled OpenCV and was similiar in application to the Task 4 : B4 but instead of a webcam we trained our model on the Youtube Video to detect Age and Gender.Models for the same can be downloaded from the net(modesl required are age-deploy,age-net,gender-deploy,gender-net,opencv-face-detector and opencv_face_detector_uint8).

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_**Overall Work Done in Phase 2**: Using OpenCV to detect faces and using which predicting their age and gender.The Notebooks for the same as listed in the folders named Task4_B3 and Task5_B4 in the reposistory._

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **Checkpoint 3 : 18 July 2021** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **5) Task 6: C1** \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task was building a andriod project using TensorFlow models to detect the face in the camera feed and to detect the age and gender of the face detected.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **6) Task 7: C2**\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task was implementing all above tasks to build a ML Model in which we train to it recongise faces.The project is intially fed a stack of images using which it encodes the iamges in order to detect the similiar faces.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_**Overall Work Done in Phase 3**:This phase marked the culmination of the all the phases and brought all tasks to let us prepare the final implementation that is Facial Recongination using Ml and building a andriod application on the same.The Project for Task 6 in the folder named Task6_C1 and the Notebook for Task 7 is in the folder Task7_C2. _

>_**This Project was  a great learning experience particularly in the diverse field called Machine Learning. The project taught the implementation of python library such as pandas,numpy,matplotlib using them to build datasets. Later usage of OpenCV to detect faces and using the pre trained models to detect age and Gender. Finally using the model and OpenCV to detect similiar faces in the image using the already uploaded images.**_
